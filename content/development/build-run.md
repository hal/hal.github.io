This page explains how to build, run and debug the console. We recommend to use Maven and the command line. This will work reliably across different environments and IDEs. 

# Build

If not already done, clone the code from https://github.com/hal/console/ or [fork](https://github.com/hal/console/fork) the repository into your own personal GitHub account.

For a full build use

```shell
mvn verify
``` 

This includes the GWT compiler, which might take a while. If you just want to make sure that there are no compilation or test failures, you can skip the GWT compiler and use

```shell
mvn verify -P skip-gwt
``` 

To build a HAL release ready to be used for WildFly or JBoss EAP use one of the following commands:

- WildFly: `mvn clean install -P prod,theme-wildfly`
- JBoss EAP: `mvn clean install -P prod,theme-eap`

## Profiles

The POM defines the following profiles:

- `native`: Used to build the native binary for the standalone mode
- `prod`: Activates GWT settings for the production build
- `release`: Builds and signs source and JavaDoc JARs
- `skip-gwt`: Skips GWT compilation
- `theme-eap`: Theme for JBoss EAP
- `theme-hal`: Theme for HAL standalone
- `theme-wildfly`: Theme for WildFly

# Development Mode

The GWT development mode starts a local Jetty server. As a one time prerequisite you need to add the URL of the local
Jetty server as an allowed origin to your WildFly / JBoss EAP configuration:

```shell
/core-service=management/management-interface=http-interface:list-add(name=allowed-origins,value=http://localhost:8888)
reload
```

resp.

```shell
/host=master/core-service=management/management-interface=http-interface:list-add(name=allowed-origins,value=http://localhost:8888)
reload --host=master
``` 

The main GWT application is located in the `app` folder. To run the console in dev mode use

```shell
cd app
mvn gwt:devmode
```

This will start the development mode. Wait until you see a message like

```
00:00:15,703 [INFO] Code server started in 15.12 s ms
```

Then open [http://localhost:8888/hal/dev.html](http://localhost:8888/hal/dev.html) in your browser and connect to your WildFly / JBoss EAP instance as described in [standalone mode]({{< relref "/documentation/get-started.md#standalone-mode" >}}).

The dev mode allows you to change code and see your changes simply by refreshing the browser. GWT will detect the
modifications and only transpile the changed sources.

# Debug

{{< imgflow src="/img/development/debug.png" float="right" >}}
Start the console as described in the previous chapter. GWT uses the [SourceMaps standard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit?usp=sharing) to map the Java source code to the transpiled JavaScript code. This makes it possible to use the browser development tools for debugging.

In Chrome open the development tools and switch to the 'Sources' tab. Press <kbd>âŒ˜ P</kbd> and type the name of the Java source file you want to open. 

Let's say we want to debug the enable / disable action in the data source column in configuration. Open the class `DataSourceColumn` and put a breakpoint on the first line of method `void setEnabled(ResourceAddress, boolean, SafeHtml)` (should be line 285). Now select a data source like the default 'ExampleDS' data source and press the enable / disable link in the preview. The browser should stop at the specified line and you can use the development tools to inspect and change variables.

##### Inspect Variables

If you're used to debug Java applications in your favorite IDE, the debugging experience in the browser development tools might feel strange at first. You can inspect simple types like boolean, numbers and strings. Support for native JavaScript types like arrays and objects is also very good. On the other hand Java types like lists or maps are not very well supported. In addition most variable names are suffixed with something like `_0_g$`. We recommend to inspect these variables using the console and call the `toString()` method on the respective object.

# Scripts

This repository contains some scripts to automate various development tasks.

## `depgraph.sh`

Generates a visual dependency graph.

## `format.sh`

Formats the codebase by applying the following maven goals:

- [`license-maven-plugin:format`](https://mycila.carbou.me/license-maven-plugin/#goals)
- [`formatter-maven-plugin:format`](https://code.revelc.net/formatter-maven-plugin/format-mojo.html)
- [`impsort-maven-plugin:sort`](https://code.revelc.net/impsort-maven-plugin/sort-mojo.html)

## `validate.sh`

Validates the codebase by applying the following maven goals:

- [`enforcer:enforce`](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/maven-enforcer-plugin/enforce-mojo.html)
- [`checkstyle:check`](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/check-mojo.html)
- [`license-maven-plugin:check`](https://mycila.carbou.me/license-maven-plugin/#goals)
- [`formatter-maven-plugin:validate`](https://code.revelc.net/formatter-maven-plugin/validate-mojo.html)
- [`impsort-maven-plugin:check`](https://code.revelc.net/impsort-maven-plugin/check-mojo.html)

## `release.sh`

Releases a new HAL version.

## `versionBump.sh`

Bumps the version to the specified version number.

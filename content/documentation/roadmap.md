HAL is community-driven and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs and contributions. You can find a list of planned issues and feature requests in our [issue tracker](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/HAL/issues).

For more details take a look at the list of [bugs](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12334684), [enhancements](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12334686) and [feature requests](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?filter=12334685). We're always happy for you to step in and [contribute]({{< relref "/documentation/contribute.md" >}}) in any way. 

# Long-Term

Beyond that we've identified some major enhancements and topics we'd like to work on:

- Migrate to PatternFly 4
- Enhance Macro Recording
- More Monitoring
- Support for OpenShift

Please [get in touch]({{< relref "/documentation/contribute.md#get-in-touch" >}}) if you think anything important is missing on the roadmap.

HAL is community-driven and as such the roadmap constantly evolves to reflect the users needs and contributions. You can find a list of planned issues and feature requests in our [issue tracker](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/HAL/issues), but this page is a good starting point to see where we are going.

# Short-Term

For the next releases we want to expose new features added to the various subsystems. This is an excerpt of issues we're currently working on:
